# Three.js Material Playground

Explores various materials and textures in Three.js, providing a GUI to interactively modify material properties.

## Material Tests

In this playground, different types of materials like `MeshPhysicalMaterial`, `MeshStandardMaterial`, and others are tested. The focus is on experimenting with advanced material properties such as:

- **Metalness**, **Roughness**
- **Sheen**, **Clearcoat**
- **Iridescence**, **Transmission**

## GUI Controls

A GUI has been implemented using `lil-gui` to allow real-time adjustment of the material properties.

## Screenshots
*Note: The screenshots above depict a simple flat plane geometry enhanced with quality textures, height maps, ambient occlusion, and other material properties.*
